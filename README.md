# 🛒 GroceryGenius — Intelligent Grocery & Meal Planning iOS App

GroceryGenius is a **modern, production-grade iOS application** designed to simplify grocery management and meal planning using **AI-assisted workflows**, **offline-first architecture**, and **scalable SwiftUI patterns**.

This project demonstrates real-world iOS engineering practices, focusing on **clean architecture**, **data consistency**, **performance**, and **maintainability**.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- AI-powered meal planning with ingredient extraction
- Smart grocery list management with deduplication
- Recipe creation, editing, tagging, and search
- Offline-first data handling with conflict-safe syncing
- Clean MVVM architecture with SwiftUI & Combine
- Firestore-backed cloud persistence
- Designed with Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 AI Meal Assistant
- Conversational AI for generating meal ideas
- Structured parsing of AI responses into ingredients
- One-tap ingredient import into grocery list
- Session-based AI conversations stored in Firestore

---

### 🛍️ Grocery Management
- Centralized grocery list per user
- Quantity tracking and item normalization
- Intelligent deduplication (case-insensitive, semantic)
- Instant UI updates with local-first writes
- Cloud synchronization with Firestore

---

### 📚 Recipe Management
- Create and edit recipes with ingredients
- Reusable ingredient editor UI
- Tag-based filtering and search
- Sorting by recency or alphabetical order
- Shared UI components between create/edit flows

---

### 🔄 Offline-First & Data Consistency
- Optimistic UI updates for responsiveness
- Firestore batch writes for efficiency
- Conflict-aware updates when reconnecting
- Designed for eventual consistency
- Single source of truth enforced at ViewModel level

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

GroceryGenius follows **MVVM with clear separation of concerns**, optimized for SwiftUI.

### Architecture Principles
- Declarative UI with SwiftUI
- ViewModels as state owners
- Business logic isolated from UI
- Thread safety using `@MainActor` and structured concurrency
- Predictable state updates via Combine

SwiftUI View
↓
ViewModel (@MainActor, ObservableObject)
↓
Service Layer (Firestore / AI / Persistence)
↓
Models (Codable, Equatable, Identifiable)

## 🧩 State Management

- `ObservableObject` + `@Published` for UI updates
- Combine pipelines for derived state
- Explicit ownership of mutable state
- No shared mutable state across views
- Clear lifecycle boundaries for async tasks

## 🔥 Firestore Data Model

```text
users/{uid}
 ├── groceryItems/{itemId}
 │     ├── name: String
 │     ├── quantity: String
 │     ├── updatedAt: Timestamp
 │
 ├── recipes/{recipeId}
 │     ├── title: String
 │     ├── ingredients: [Ingredient]
 │     ├── tags: [String]
 │     ├── createdAt: Timestamp
 │     ├── updatedAt: Timestamp
 │
 └── aiMeals/{conversationId}
       ├── createdAt: Timestamp
       ├── updatedAt: Timestamp
       └── messages/{messageId}
            ├── text: String
            ├── isUser: Bool

Design Notes
One AI conversation per app session

Subcollections used for scalability

Timestamps used for ordering & conflict resolution

Designed to support future multi-device sync

🧪 Offline & Sync Strategy
Local state updates immediately reflect in UI

Firestore writes queued automatically when offline

Batched updates reduce network overhead

Latest-write-wins conflict strategy

Designed to evolve toward versioned conflict resolution
